      So, I made a blog site. Was it easy? Yes, but also no. This blog is the first published product after just over two years learning 
      ReactJS. In that time there have been many ideas which have amounted to a near useless library of components scattered around my
      computer. This site itself took around half a day to create, without any major glitches - so yes it was easy, but it came at the cost
      of many head-scratching, hair-pulling, head-banging-on-desk frustrating times. Let's hope this is worth it!

      Thanks for the short read!
